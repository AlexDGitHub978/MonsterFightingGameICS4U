## Game Summary

Step by step:
> Create a player class (ask the user their name, generate health and attack)
> Show the user their health and attack values
> Ask how many monsters the user wants to defeat
> Create that many monster instances in an array
> Ask if the user wants to see the tutorial (only once in the whole program)
> Game will start
> Double loops (one for looping through monsters, one for looping through turn based combat inside of the other loop)
> Will begin going through an array of monsters and introduce the monster to the player: (name, health)
> Will ask player to do a simple contest of reskinned rock paper scissors
> Whoever wins will have their damage value subtracted from the otherâ€™s health
> They do this until one of them dies
> Each cycle the computer displays the health of the computer and player
> The next monster appears
> Process repeats until the user defeats the number of monsters that they specified
> The user is asked if they want to play again
